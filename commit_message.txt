feat(baseline): Extract baseline analyzer to standalone package

This commit extracts the P0 baseline analyzer functionality into a new,
standalone Python package named `baseline_analyzer` located under `src/`.
The original `balance_pipeline` package remains untouched and importable,
ensuring the production pipeline is not affected by this refactoring.

Key changes include:

1.  **New Package Structure:**
    *   Created `src/baseline_analyzer/` directory.
    *   Added `src/baseline_analyzer/__init__.py`.
    *   Copied core P0 refactored files (`config.py`, `processing.py`,
        `recon.py`) from `balance_pipeline` to `baseline_analyzer`.
    *   Created a new `src/baseline_analyzer/cli.py` for the dedicated
        `baseline-analyze` command.
    *   Moved `rules.yaml` from `src/balance_pipeline/` to
        `src/baseline_analyzer/`.

2.  **Configuration Updates (`pyproject.toml`):**
    *   Updated project description to reflect the new analyzer.
    *   Added `baseline_analyzer` to the `[tool.poetry.packages]` list.
    *   Added `structlog` as a project dependency.
    *   Defined a new script entry point:
        `baseline-analyze = "baseline_analyzer.cli:main"`

3.  **Testing Configuration:**
    *   Created `pytest.ini` in the project root to scope primary tests:
        ```ini
        [pytest]
        addopts = -q
        testpaths = tests/baseline
        ```
    *   Created the `tests/baseline/` directory for new baseline-specific tests.

This separation allows for independent development and maintenance of the
baseline analyzer while preserving the stability of the main Balance pipeline.
The new `baseline-analyze` CLI tool provides a dedicated interface for
generating the `baseline_snapshot.csv`.
