### Why BALANCE-pyexcel?

* **One pipeline for every bank.**  YAML-driven schemas mean you add a new institution without touching Python.  
* **Excel-friendly.**  Keep your macro-enabled workbook; BALANCE updates data via a temp file so VBA survives.  
* **Headless or hybrid.**  Use the CLI for automation, or fire the pipeline from a button inside Excel.  
* **Open formats.**  Everything ends up in Parquet + SQLite for easy BI and long-term auditability.  

Happy balancing!  Feel free to open issues or PRs on GitHub if you hit a snag or have an idea.
