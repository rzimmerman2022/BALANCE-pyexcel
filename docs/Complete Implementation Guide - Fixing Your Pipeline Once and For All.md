# Complete Implementation Guide: Fixing Your Pipeline Once and For All

## Why This Time Is Different

Previous attempts failed because they only changed the schemas (the instructions) without changing the pipeline (the machine following those instructions). It's like translating a recipe into French when your chef only speaks English - the translation is perfect but useless.

This implementation changes both:
1. **New schemas** that match reality instead of fantasy
2. **New pipeline logic** that creates only columns with data
3. **Built-in validation** that catches problems immediately

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Back Up Your Current Setup
Before we rebuild, preserve your current work:
```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir C:\BALANCE\BALANCE-pyexcel\backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Copy current schemas and pipeline
cp rules/*.yaml backup_*/
cp src/balance_pipeline/*.py backup_*/
```

### Step 2: Install the New Canonical Schema
Save the `canonical_schema_v3.py` file to your project. This defines what "clean data" looks like - only fields that actually matter, no phantom columns.

### Step 3: Update Your Schema Files
Replace your existing schema files with the reality-based versions:

1. **ryan_monarch_v2.yaml** - Maps "Merchant" correctly, parses dates
2. **ryan_rocket_v2.yaml** - Maps "Account Name" to Account, fixes date parsing
3. Update Jordyn's schemas similarly (I can generate these once we confirm Ryan's work)

Key changes in each schema:
- Only map columns that actually exist
- Add explicit date parsing with correct format
- Set `extra_columns: ignore` to prevent phantom fields

### Step 4: Replace the CSV Consolidator
The current consolidator creates all 27 columns regardless. Replace it with `smart_csv_consolidator.py` which:
- Only creates columns that contain data
- Parses dates immediately after reading
- Validates data quality during processing
- Logs what it's actually doing so you can debug

### Step 5: Update Your CLI Command
Modify your pipeline CLI to use the new consolidator:
```python
# In cli.py, replace the consolidator import
from smart_csv_consolidator import SmartConsolidator

# Update the processing logic
consolidator = SmartConsolidator(schema_dir='rules')
```

### Step 6: Run the New Pipeline
```bash
# Process all sources with the new logic
poetry run python src/balance_pipeline/cli.py \
    "C:\BALANCE\CSVs" \
    "workbook/balance_final_v3.parquet" \
    -v --log "logs/foundational_rebuild.log"
```

### Step 7: Verify Success
Run this verification script:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the new output
df = pd.read_parquet('workbook/balance_final_v3.parquet')

print(f"Total records: {len(df)}")
print(f"Total columns: {len(df.columns)} (should be ~15-17, not 27)")
print(f"\nColumns present: {', '.join(df.columns)}")

# Check date validity
date_valid = df['Date'].notna().sum()
print(f"\nValid dates: {date_valid}/{len(df)} ({date_valid/len(df)*100:.1f}%)")

# Check by source
for source in df['DataSourceName'].unique():
    source_df = df[df['DataSourceName'] == source]
    print(f"\n{source}:")
    print(f"  Records: {len(source_df)}")
    print(f"  Valid dates: {source_df['Date'].notna().sum()}/{len(source_df)}")
    print(f"  Columns with data: {source_df.notna().sum().gt(0).sum()}")
```

## Making It Extensible for Future Banks

The beauty of this approach is how easy it becomes to add new sources:

### Adding a New Bank (Example: Chase Sapphire)
1. Create `ryan_chase_sapphire_v1.yaml`:
```yaml
file_pattern: "ryan.*chase.*sapphire.*\.csv"

# Map only columns that exist in Chase's export
column_map:
  Transaction Date: Date
  Post Date: PostDate  
  Description: Description
  Amount: Amount
  Type: Category
  Balance: Balance  # New field specific to this card

date_columns:
  - column: Date
    format: "%m/%d/%Y"
  - column: PostDate
    format: "%m/%d/%Y"

derived_columns:
  Owner:
    type: constant
    value: "Ryan"
  Institution:
    type: constant
    value: "Chase"
  AccountLast4:
    type: extract_from_filename
    pattern: "x(\\d{4})"

extra_columns: ignore
```

2. The pipeline automatically:
   - Detects the new schema
   - Maps available fields
   - Ignores non-existent fields
   - Parses dates correctly
   - Only creates columns with data

No code changes needed!

## What Success Looks Like

After implementing this:
1. **Power BI** shows only columns with actual data (~15-17 columns, not 27)
2. **Dates** are 100% valid for all sources
3. **No phantom columns** full of nulls
4. **Each source** contributes only fields it actually has
5. **Adding new banks** requires only a YAML file, no code changes

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't force uniformity** - Let different sources be different
2. **Don't create empty columns** - If a source doesn't have it, don't fake it
3. **Parse dates immediately** - String dates are not dates
4. **Validate continuously** - Catch problems during processing, not after

## Next Steps

1. Implement Steps 1-7 above
2. Verify all dates parse correctly (should see 100% valid)
3. Confirm Power BI shows clean data without phantom columns
4. Create schemas for any additional sources using the template

The fundamental difference this time is that we're working with your data as it actually is, not as we wish it were. We're building a system that adapts to reality rather than trying to force reality to adapt to our system.

This is your foundation - lean, honest, and extensible. No more phantom columns, no more date parsing failures, no more clusters in Power BI. Just clean, analyzable financial data that tells you what you actually need to know.
