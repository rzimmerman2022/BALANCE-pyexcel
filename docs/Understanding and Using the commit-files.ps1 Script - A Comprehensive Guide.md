# Understanding and Using the commit-files.ps1 Script: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction: Why This Script Matters

Imagine you're a craftsperson who needs to document every change you make to your work. You could write notes haphazardly on scraps of paper, or you could develop a systematic approach that ensures nothing important is forgotten. The commit-files.ps1 script is like having a skilled assistant who guides you through the documentation process every time, ensuring consistency and completeness.

This guide will walk you through not just how to use the script, but why each feature exists and how it helps you become a better developer. Think of this as learning to drive a car properly, not just memorizing which pedal makes it go.

## Understanding the Script's Philosophy

Before diving into the mechanics, let's understand the thinking behind this tool. Git commits are like entries in a ship's logbook - they record not just what happened, but why it happened and what it means for the journey ahead. Poor commit messages are like writing "Tuesday: did stuff" in your logbook, while good ones are like "Tuesday: Adjusted course 15 degrees north to avoid storm system, estimated arrival now Thursday instead of Wednesday."

The script embodies three core principles that guide professional development:

First, verification at every step prevents cascading errors. Just as a pilot goes through a pre-flight checklist, this script verifies each action before proceeding to the next. This might seem slow at first, but it prevents the much slower process of fixing mistakes later.

Second, flexibility without chaos. The script offers multiple ways to accomplish the same task, much like how a good kitchen has different knives for different jobs. You can work quickly when appropriate or take your time when precision matters.

Third, education through action. Rather than just executing commands, the script explains what's happening, helping you internalize Git's workflow. It's like learning to cook with a chef who explains why you're using each technique, not just telling you to follow steps blindly.

## Installation and Setup

Setting up the script is straightforward, but understanding where to place it matters for your workflow. Think of it like choosing where to hang your most-used tools in a workshop.

Save the script in one of these locations, depending on your needs:

If you want it available in just one project, place it in your project's root directory. This is like keeping a specialized tool right where you need it. Navigate to your project folder and save the script there as commit-files.ps1.

If you want it available across all your projects, create a dedicated scripts folder. This is like having a toolbox you can carry to any job site. Create a folder such as C:\Scripts or C:\Users\YourName\Scripts, save the script there, and add that folder to your system's PATH environment variable. This way, you can call the script from anywhere.

To verify the script is ready to use, open PowerShell in your project directory and type:
```powershell
Get-Command .\commit-files.ps1
```

If PowerShell recognizes the script, you're ready to proceed. If you encounter execution policy errors, you may need to run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

This tells Windows it's safe to run PowerShell scripts you've created or explicitly downloaded.

## Basic Usage: Your First Commit

Let's start with the simplest way to use the script, then build up to more advanced techniques. Think of this like learning to drive in an empty parking lot before tackling city streets.

### The Interactive Approach

When you run the script without any parameters, it becomes your guide:

```powershell
.\commit-files.ps1
```

The script will first show you what files have changed in your repository. This is like laying out all your ingredients before cooking - you see everything that's available to work with. You'll see something like:

```
=== File Selection ===
Current modified files:
M  calculator.py
M  README.md
?? tests/test_calculator.py

Enter file(s) to commit (comma-separated, or '.' for all):
```

Here, 'M' means modified files, while '??' indicates new files Git hasn't seen before. You can respond in several ways:

Typing a single filename like "calculator.py" tells the script to focus on just that file. This is perfect when you've made changes to multiple files but want to commit them separately with different messages.

Typing multiple filenames separated by commas like "calculator.py,tests/test_calculator.py" groups related changes together. This is ideal when you've added a feature and its tests, as they logically belong in the same commit.

Typing a period (.) selects all changed files. Use this when all your changes are part of the same logical unit of work.

After file selection, the script will show you exactly what changed in each file (unless you've used the -SkipDiff flag). This diff view is like proofreading your work before submitting it. Red lines (starting with -) show what was removed, while green lines (starting with +) show what was added.

### Building Your Commit Message

This is where the script truly shines. Instead of staring at a blank cursor wondering what to write, the script guides you through creating a structured, meaningful commit message.

When prompted for a brief summary, think of this as the headline of a news article. It should be 50 characters or less and explain what the commit does, not what you did. For example:

Good: "Fix division by zero error in calculate_average"
Less good: "Fixed a bug I found this morning"

The script then asks for details about what changed. This is where you list the specific modifications, like:
- Added input validation for empty lists
- Replaced direct division with safe_divide function
- Updated error messages to be more descriptive

Next, it asks why these changes matter. This context is invaluable when someone (including future you) needs to understand the reasoning. Examples might be:
- Prevents application crashes when processing empty datasets
- Provides clearer feedback to users about what went wrong
- Aligns error handling with project coding standards

## Advanced Usage: Power User Techniques

Once you're comfortable with the basics, the script offers several ways to work more efficiently. These are like learning keyboard shortcuts - not necessary at first, but incredibly powerful once mastered.

### Quick Mode for Simple Changes

When you're fixing a typo or making a simple change that doesn't need extensive documentation, use Quick Mode:

```powershell
.\commit-files.ps1 -QuickMode
```

This streamlines the process, asking only for essential information. It's like the difference between writing a formal letter and sending a quick text message - both have their place.

### Direct Parameter Passing

For maximum efficiency, you can provide all information upfront:

```powershell
.\commit-files.ps1 -Files "config.json" -Message "Update API endpoint to new server URL"
```

This approach works well when you know exactly what you're committing and why. It's particularly useful in scripts or automated workflows where you want to commit programmatically.

### Combining Multiple Files

When working on a feature that spans multiple files, you can commit them together:

```powershell
.\commit-files.ps1 -Files "models/user.py,views/auth.py,tests/test_auth.py" -Message "Implement two-factor authentication"
```

This ensures related changes stay together in your project history, making it easier to understand or revert complete features later.

### Skipping the Diff Review

If you've already reviewed your changes in your editor or are confident about what you're committing:

```powershell
.\commit-files.ps1 -SkipDiff -Files "documentation.md"
```

This saves time but removes a safety check, so use it judiciously.

## Understanding Commit Messages: No Placeholders Needed

You asked about placeholders in commit messages, and this is an important distinction to understand. Unlike template systems that use placeholders like {{FILENAME}} or ${DATE}, this script takes a different approach - it builds messages dynamically through conversation.

Think of the difference like this: A template with placeholders is like a form letter where you fill in blanks. What this script does is more like having a conversation with an experienced colleague who asks you the right questions to help you articulate your thoughts.

When the script builds your commit message, it's combining your responses in real-time. For example, when you provide:
- Summary: "Add user authentication"
- What changed: "Created login endpoint", "Added password hashing"
- Why it matters: "Secures user accounts", "Meets security requirements"

The script assembles these into a properly formatted commit message:

```
Add user authentication

What changed:
- Created login endpoint
- Added password hashing

Why it matters:
- Secures user accounts
- Meets security requirements
```

This approach is more flexible than placeholders because it adapts to what you provide. If you don't have breaking changes, that section simply doesn't appear. If you add a ticket reference, it's appended appropriately.

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

Let's walk through some real-world situations you'll encounter and how to handle them effectively.

### Scenario: The Multi-Part Feature

You're working on a new feature that involves changes to the database schema, business logic, and user interface. You've modified eight files, but they represent three logical changes.

Instead of committing all eight files at once with a vague message, or making eight tiny commits, you can group them logically:

First commit - Database changes:
```powershell
.\commit-files.ps1 -Files "schema.sql,migrations/add_user_preferences.py"
```

Second commit - Business logic:
```powershell
.\commit-files.ps1 -Files "models/user.py,services/preferences.py"
```

Third commit - UI updates:
```powershell
.\commit-files.ps1 -Files "static/js/preferences.js,templates/preferences.html,static/css/preferences.css"
```

Each commit tells a complete story about one aspect of your feature.

### Scenario: The Emergency Hotfix

Production is down, you've identified the fix, and you need to commit and deploy immediately. This is where Quick Mode shines:

```powershell
.\commit-files.ps1 -QuickMode -Files "api/payment_handler.py" -Message "Fix null pointer exception in payment processing"
```

Quick, efficient, but still properly documented.

### Scenario: The Exploratory Coding Session

You've been experimenting and have changes across many files, some of which you want to keep and others you don't. Run the script without parameters and use the interactive mode to carefully select only the files you want to commit. The diff review feature helps you remember what each change does.

## Best Practices and Professional Tips

As you become more comfortable with the script, these practices will help you maintain a professional-grade repository:

Commit related changes together, but keep commits focused. A commit should represent one logical change. If you find yourself writing "and" multiple times in your summary, consider splitting into multiple commits.

Write commit messages as if you're explaining the change to a colleague who will read it in six months. They (or you) won't remember the context, so provide it explicitly.

Use the "why" section to reference business requirements, bug reports, or design decisions. This creates a valuable historical record of not just what changed, but why decisions were made.

Take advantage of the script's verification steps. That final status check might reveal you forgot to commit a crucial file, saving you from a broken build.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If the script seems to hang after showing a diff, remember that Git's diff viewer is waiting for you to press 'q' to quit. This is like closing a book after reading - you need to explicitly tell it you're done.

If you get permissions errors, ensure you're running PowerShell as your normal user account (not as Administrator unless necessary) and that you have write permissions in your repository.

If commits aren't pushing automatically, the script detects when your local branch has diverged from the remote and warns you. This is a safety feature preventing you from accidentally overwriting others' work.

## Growing Beyond the Script

As you use this script, you'll internalize Git's workflow. Eventually, you might find yourself running Git commands directly for simple operations while still using the script for complex commits. This is perfectly normal and shows you're growing as a developer.

The script is meant to be a teaching tool as much as a utility. Pay attention to the Git commands it runs - these are the same commands you can use directly when needed. Think of it like training wheels that help you learn to balance while still being useful tools in their own right.

## Conclusion: Your Commit Workflow Journey

This script transforms one of development's most repetitive tasks into an opportunity for learning and improvement. By guiding you through best practices every time, it helps build habits that will serve you throughout your career.

Remember, good commit messages are an act of kindness to your future self and your teammates. They're the story of your project's evolution, told one commit at a time. This script helps you tell that story well.

As you continue using the script, you'll develop your own patterns and preferences. You might find yourself always using Quick Mode for certain types of changes, or preferring the interactive mode for complex features. This personalization is part of mastering any tool - making it work the way you think.

Keep this guide handy as you explore the script's features. Like any powerful tool, it reveals its full potential gradually as you encounter different scenarios. Each commit is an opportunity to practice and improve your development workflow.

Happy committing, and remember: every great codebase is built one well-documented commit at a time.
