## üöÄ **Using Custom Business Rules**

### **Step 1: Edit the Configuration**
```powershell
# Open the business rules file
notepad config/business_rules.yml

# Make your changes and save
```

### **Step 2: Run the Pipeline**
```powershell
# Process with updated business rules
.\pipeline.ps1 process

# The changes take effect immediately
```

### **Step 3: Verify Changes**
```powershell
# Check the pipeline status
.\pipeline.ps1 status

# Review outputs to confirm rule changes
```

## üìä **Impact of Business Rules**

### **Settlement Keywords**
- **Purpose**: Identifies transactions between parties for balance calculations
- **Impact**: Affects who-owes-who calculations and settlement tracking
- **Example**: Adding "bitcoin" would recognize crypto transfers as settlements

### **Payer Split**
- **Purpose**: Determines how shared expenses are allocated
- **Impact**: Changes the percentage split for all shared transactions
- **Example**: 50/50 split vs 43/57 split affects balance calculations

### **Merchant Categories**
- **Purpose**: Categorizes transactions for analysis and reporting
- **Impact**: Affects category-based reports and spending analysis
- **Example**: Adding "Pet Care" creates a new spending category

### **Outlier Thresholds**
- **Purpose**: Identifies unusual transactions for review
- **Impact**: Affects which transactions are flagged as outliers
- **Example**: Lowering amount threshold catches smaller unusual transactions

### **Data Quality Rules**
- **Purpose**: Controls data validation and duplicate detection
- **Impact**: Affects data cleaning and quality assurance
- **Example**: Shorter duplicate window catches more potential duplicates

### **Rent Analysis**
- **Purpose**: Validates rent payments against expected amounts
- **Impact**: Affects rent-specific analysis and variance reporting
- **Example**: Updating baseline reflects rent increases

### **Risk Assessment**
- **Purpose**: Identifies potential financial risks
- **Impact**: Affects risk reporting and alerts
- **Example**: Lower thresholds provide earlier risk warnings

## üß™ **Testing Business Rules Changes**

### **Before Making Changes**
```powershell
# Run a baseline analysis
.\pipeline.ps1 analyze

# Note current results
```

### **After Making Changes**
```powershell
# Process with new rules
.\pipeline.ps1 process

# Compare results
.\pipeline.ps1 analyze

# Verify expected changes occurred
```

---

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Rules Not Taking Effect**
1. Check YAML syntax is valid
2. Ensure file is saved as UTF-8
3. Restart any running processes
4. Run `.\pipeline.ps1 status` to verify configuration

### **Invalid YAML Syntax**
```powershell
# Test YAML validity
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config/business_rules.yml'))"
```

### **Unexpected Categorization**
1. Check merchant name spelling and case
2. Verify category structure in YAML
3. Test with debug mode: `.\pipeline.ps1 process -Debug`
