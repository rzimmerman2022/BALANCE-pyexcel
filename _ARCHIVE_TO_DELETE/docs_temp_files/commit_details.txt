Fix: Resolve pytest collection errors

This commit addresses two primary errors that were preventing pytest from collecting all tests successfully:

1.  **Resolved `FileNotFoundError` in `test_monarch_mapping.py`:**
    *   The test previously relied on a hardcoded absolute path (`C:\BALANCE\CSVs\Ryan\Ryan - Monarch Money - 20250524.csv`) which was not found.
    *   Added a new fixture file `fixtures/dummy_monarch_data.csv` containing minimal representative data for Monarch Money exports.
    *   Updated `test_monarch_mapping.py` to use this relative path, making the test more portable and robust.

2.  **Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` in `test_transformation.py`:**
    *   The test was attempting to import `load_merchant_lookup_rules` from a non-existent module (`balance_pipeline.merchant_rules`).
    *   Corrected the import statement to source `load_merchant_lookup_rules` from its actual location in `balance_pipeline.csv_consolidator`.
    *   Modified the function call to `load_merchant_lookup_rules` to correctly pass the `Path` object for the `rules/merchant_lookup.csv` file, as expected by the function.

These changes ensure that the test suite can be collected and run without the previously encountered `FileNotFoundError` and `ModuleNotFoundError`.
