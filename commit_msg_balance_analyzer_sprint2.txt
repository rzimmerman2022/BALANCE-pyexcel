Baseline Analyzer Sprint #2 — Opening Balance Stub & Tests

SUMMARY
-------
Introduce a public stub for opening balance injection and its corresponding
unit test, scoped strictly to *src/baseline_analyzer/* and tests.

DETAILS
-------
* **src/baseline_analyzer/opening_balance.py**
  • Added new module with `inject_opening_balance(df, cfg)` that currently
    returns a copy of the input DataFrame (no-op placeholder).
  • Includes full docstring and type hints for future expansion.

* **src/baseline_analyzer/__init__.py**
  • Publicly re-exported `inject_opening_balance`.
  • Extended `__all__` to include the new symbol.

* **tests/balance_analyzer/test_inject_stub.py**
  • New test builds a tiny DataFrame, calls the stub with `load_config()`,
    and asserts the result is identical (values and index) while confirming
    a copy is returned.

VALIDATION
----------
`pytest tests/balance_analyzer -q` → all tests passed (100 % green).

NEXT STEPS
----------
Future sprints will replace this stub with real opening-balance mutation
logic. For now this ensures the public API is locked in and test-covered.
