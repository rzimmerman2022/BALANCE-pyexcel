Refactor: Comprehensive Schema Registry Cleanup and Fixes

This commit addresses several issues within the schema registry to improve accuracy, reduce redundancy, and ensure correct data processing.

Key Changes:

1.  **Standardized Active Schemas:**
    *   Updated `ryan_monarch_v1.yaml` and `ryan_rocket_v1.yaml` with the correct four-column architecture mappings for `OriginalMerchant` and `OriginalDescription`.
    *   Ensured `extras_ignore` settings in these schemas align with the new mappings.
    *   Added explicit `file_pattern` entries to all actively used individual schema files (`ryan_monarch_v1.yaml`, `ryan_rocket_v1.yaml`, `jordyn_chase_checking_v1.yaml`, `jordyn_discover_card_v1.yaml`, `jordyn_wells_v1.yaml`) to make file matching more robust and clear.

2.  **Deactivated Duplicate/Legacy Schemas:**
    *   Commented out unused schema definition files:
        *   `rules/ryan_monarch_v2.yaml`
        *   `rules/ryan_rocket_v2.yaml`
        *   `rules/jordyn_wellsfargo_visa_v1.yaml`
    *   In `rules/schema_registry.yml`:
        *   Commented out inline schema definitions that were duplicates or not being matched by current files: `monarch_export`, `rocket_money`, `chase_total_checking`, `discover_it_card`, `wells_fargo_card`.
        *   Commented out the file reference to the now-deactivated `jordyn_wellsfargo_visa_v1.yaml`.
    *   All commented-out schemas include a "LEGACY SCHEMA" note explaining why they were deactivated.

3.  **Corrected `merchant_variations.json` Structure:**
    *   Transformed `transaction_analysis_results/merchant_variations.json` from an array of complex objects to the simple key-value dictionary format expected by `ComprehensiveTransactionCleaner`. This was achieved by running `transform_merchant_variations.py`.

4.  **Auxiliary Script Updates (`check_schema_matching.py`):**
    *   Modified `check_schema_matching.py` to correctly import and use `find_matching_schema` from `balance_pipeline.schema_registry.py` and configuration variables from `balance_pipeline.config.py`, resolving previous import errors.

These changes ensure that CSV files are matched to the correct, updated schemas, fixes for column mappings are now effective, and the merchant standardization process uses the correctly formatted variation data. This resolves the issue of fixes to `monarch_export` (and similar unused schemas) not being applied.
