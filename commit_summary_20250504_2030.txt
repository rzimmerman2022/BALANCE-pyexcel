feat: Address P0/P1 issues - Config, CI, Docs, PDF Script

This commit addresses several priority issues identified in the project gaps list.

**P0 Fixes:**

1.  **Merchant Lookup Path Configuration:**
    *   Added `MERCHANT_LOOKUP_PATH` variable to `src/balance_pipeline/config.py` to centralize path management.
    *   Modified `src/balance_pipeline/merchant.py` to import `config` and utilize `MERCHANT_LOOKUP_PATH`, removing the hardcoded relative path. This improves robustness for packaging.
    *   Corrected indentation errors introduced during previous edits in `merchant.py`.

2.  **Queue_Review Template Enhancement:**
    *   Updated the `_create_queue_review_template` function in `src/balance_pipeline/cli.py` to include the `CanonMerchant` column in the generated Excel template, providing reviewers with the canonical merchant name for context.

3.  **CI Ghostscript Dependency (Windows):**
    *   Added a conditional step to `workflows/ci.yml` to install Ghostscript using `choco install ghostscript -y` specifically for the `windows-latest` runner in the `test` job matrix. This ensures PDF processing dependencies are available for future tests on Windows runners.

**P1 Fixes:**

1.  **Executable Artifact Documentation & Spec File:**
    *   Added a build status badge to `README.md`.
    *   Included instructions in `README.md` on how to download the pre-built Windows executable (`.exe`) from GitHub Actions artifacts.
    *   Generated the `balance-pyexcel.spec` file locally using PyInstaller (matching the CI build command) and added it to the repository. This allows developers to easily inspect and modify build configurations if needed.

2.  **PDF Processing Script (`process_pdfs.py`):**
    *   Modified script arguments to accept the main CSV inbox path and the specific owner's name, rather than a generic output directory.
    *   Updated the `process_pdf` function to concatenate all tables extracted from a single PDF into one DataFrame.
    *   Changed the output logic to save the combined DataFrame as a single CSV file directly into the specified owner's subfolder within the main CSV inbox.
    *   Implemented the deterministic naming convention: `BALANCE - <OwnerName> PDF - <OriginalPDFName>.csv`.
    *   Corrected indentation errors introduced during previous edits.

3.  **DuckDB Connectivity Documentation:**
    *   Created a sample ODBC connection file (`samples/Connect_DuckDB_Parquet.odc`) to facilitate easy connection from Excel.
    *   Updated the "Using DuckDB for Analysis (Optional)" section in `README.md` to include:
        *   Clear instructions on installing the DuckDB ODBC driver (MSI recommended).
        *   Guidance on using the provided `.odc` file or configuring a DSN for Excel.
        *   An example connection string for connecting directly from Power BI without a DSN.
