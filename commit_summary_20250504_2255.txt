feat(pdf ingest): switch to Tabula, add encoding fallback, formalize jordyn_pdf schema, and ship green integration test

Context
-------
Camelot + Ghostscript proved brittle on Windows.  We pivoted to Tabula-py
(stream mode) and hardened the ingest pipeline for Jordyn’s PDF
statements.  Two iterations followed:

1. first wave – library switch, encoding fallback, schema definition,
   fixture & test scaffolding;
2. second wave – bug-fixes (NA handling, sign rule, TxnID safety) and
   removal of a temporary single-file filter.

All are collected here so main now builds & tests cleanly.

Highlights
----------

🗂 **scripts/process_pdfs.py**
• Replaced `camelot.read_pdf` with `tabula.read_pdf(stream=True, guess=True)`.
• Added `read_with_fallback` which tries:
    – UTF-8  
    – CP-1252 (Windows “smart-quotes” set)  
    – UTF-8 + `errors='ignore'`
• Logged per-file encoding path; exits with 0 failures across 11 PDFs.
• Graceful JVM shutdown via `jpype.shutdownJVM()` when applicable.

📜 **rules/schema_registry.yml**
• Finalized **jordyn_pdf** block  
  – `match_filename: "BALANCE - Jordyn PDF -*.csv"`  
  – 15-column `column_map` (Skip_1…Skip_9 ➜ `_`, AccountLast4 ➜
    `AcctLast4`, etc.)  
  – `sign_rule: flip_if_positive` to align credits⇢-debits convention.

🧪 **tests/**
• `fixtures/jordyn_pdf_sample.csv` – 3-row slice with YYYY dates.
• `test_pdf_ingest.py`
  – Loads fixture via temp inbox, runs `load_folder` → `normalize_df`.
  – Asserts `FINAL_COLS`, owner = “Jordyn”, amount sign, row-count.

🩹 **src/balance_pipeline/normalize.py**
• `_txn_id` and `prefer_source_sorter` now `pd.isna()`-safe for Bank /
  Account / Source fields, eliminating “boolean value of NA is ambiguous”.
• `SplitPercent` now initialised with `pd.NA` to avoid dtype promotion.

📦 **pyproject.toml**
• Removed `camelot-py` dependency.
• Added `tabula-py` dependency.
• Note: `jpype1` is an optional dependency for `tabula-py` (for potential speedup) but not explicitly added here yet.

⚙️ **workflows/ci.yml**
• Removed `Install Ghostscript (Windows only)` step from the `test` job matrix, as it's no longer needed by Tabula.

🔧 **misc**
• Removed temporary “process only Document (7).pdf” guard.
• `.gitignore` already covers `dist/` for PyInstaller artefacts.

Outcome
-------
*All* Jordyn PDFs convert → CSV, ingest, normalise, and the
`test_pdf_ingest` suite is green on Windows & Ubuntu CI.  This unblocks
stakeholders from loading December statements immediately.

BREAKING CHANGE: Camelot is no longer a dependency; ensure
`pyproject.toml` lockfile is refreshed.
