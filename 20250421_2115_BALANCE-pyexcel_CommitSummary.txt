Update Summary - April 21, 2025
Project: BALANCE-pyexcel

Version Target: v0.1.0 (Initial Setup)

Context:
This update represents the foundational setup for the BALANCE-pyexcel project. The goal was to establish a clean, modern Python project structure integrated with Git for version control and Poetry for dependency/environment management, alongside the skeleton Excel workbook. This prepares the project for the implementation of the Python-in-Excel ETL pipeline for shared finance tracking. All prerequisite tools (Git, Python, pipx, Poetry) were installed and verified before project setup.

Changes Verified/Implemented in this Update:

1.  Repository Setup:
    * Initialized a new Git repository in the project root directory (`C:\BALANCE\BALANCE-pyexcel-repository\BALANCE-pyexcel\`).
    * Configured global Git settings (user name, user email, default branch name 'main').

2.  Environment & Dependency Management:
    * Initialized the project using `poetry init`, creating `pyproject.toml`.
    * Added core runtime dependencies (`pandas`, `python-dotenv`) using `poetry add`.
    * Added development dependencies (`pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `black`, `ruff`) to the 'dev' group using `poetry add --group dev`.
    * Successfully resolved and installed all dependencies into a Poetry-managed virtual environment (`balance-pyexcel-pipeline-fCJTT6-F-py3.13`).
    * Generated the `poetry.lock` file, ensuring reproducible dependency installation.

3.  Directory Structure Created:
    * Established standard Python project layout including:
        * `src/balance_pipeline/` (for main Python package code)
        * `tests/` (for unit tests)
        * `rules/` (placeholder for rule definition files)
        * `sample_data/` (placeholder for example input CSVs)
    * Added necessary empty files (`__init__.py`, `.gitkeep`) to ensure structure is recognized and folders can be tracked by Git if empty.

4.  Documentation & Configuration Files:
    * Created and populated `README.md` with project overview, setup instructions, and structure.
    * Created and populated `architecture.md` with high-level design, data flow (Mermaid diagram), layers, and key decisions.
    * Created and populated `.gitignore` with standard Python, Poetry, VS Code, OS, and temporary file patterns to exclude from version control.

5.  Excel Workbook Skeleton:
    * Created the main workbook `BALANCE-pyexcel.xlsm`.
    * Manually added the required sheets: `Dashboard`, `Transactions`, `Queue_Review`, `Config`, `Rules_Merchants`, `Rules_Shared`.
    * Added specified headers to `Transactions` and `Queue_Review` sheets.
    * Set up label/value structure in `Config` sheet.
    * Added headers, formatted as Excel Tables, and named tables (`tblMerchantRules`, `tblSharedRules`) in `Rules_Merchants` and `Rules_Shared` sheets respectively.

Current State (After this initial setup):
* The Git repository is initialized and contains the complete project scaffolding.
* The Poetry environment is configured with all necessary base dependencies installed and locked.
* The standard Python project directory structure is in place with empty source/test files.
* Core documentation files (`README.md`, `architecture.md`) provide project context.
* The Excel workbook (`BALANCE-pyexcel.xlsm`) contains the required sheets and basic structure, ready for configuration input and data output/interaction via Python.
* No functional Python code for the ETL pipeline exists yet within the `.py` files.

Next Steps:
* Make the initial Git commit to save this baseline state.
* Begin implementation of Python ETL logic (Refined Plan: Phase 2), starting with defining configurations (`config.py`), helper functions (`utils.py`), data ingestion (`ingest.py`), and data normalization (`normalize.py`).
* Add detailed docstrings, type hints, and function signatures within the Python files to improve clarity and AI-assistability.
* Populate `sample_data` with anonymized example CSVs to test ingestion.
* Write initial unit tests for implemented functions in `tests/`.
* Implement the Python cell code (`=PY(...)`) in Excel to connect and run the pipeline (Refined Plan: Phase 3).
