feat: add combined_transactions.parquet master file

WHAT: Added a unified typed Parquet output for all transaction data.

WHY: Enable direct Power BI connection to a single source of truth with
     consistent schema and types, eliminating the need for multiple CSV imports.

HOW:
- Added append_to_master() function in process_pdfs.py that guarantees schema
- Process creates data/processed/ directory on-the-fly as needed
- Added data/processed/ to .gitignore to keep repo clean
- Fixed failing test_txnid_unique_real_file with a checked-in fixture
- Added comprehensive unit tests in test_master_parquet.py
- All tests pass with the new implementation (31 tests)

SCHEMA: ["TransDate", "PostDate", "RawMerchant", "Amount", 
         "AccountLast4", "ReferenceNumber", "Owner"]
with proper type coercion (dates and numeric values)
