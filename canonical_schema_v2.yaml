  # SCHEMA STATISTICS

  # IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
  implementation:
    backwards_compatibility: |
      The following fields from v1 are renamed or consolidated:
      - OriginalDescription → Description (for Jordyn sources)
      - InstitutionName → Institution (for Ryan sources)
      - Notes/Note → Removed (use Tags if needed)
      
    extras_handling: |
      Any columns not mapped should still be preserved in an 'Extras' JSON field
      This provides safety during transition and captures unexpected data
      
    validation_rules:
      - Required fields must be non-null
      - Amount must be numeric
      - Dates must be valid date format
      - TxnID must be unique within the dataset
      
    power_bi_considerations: |
      - All text fields should be cast to string type
      - Empty numeric fields should be NULL, not empty string
      - Date fields should use consistent format
      - Boolean fields should use consistent TRUE/FALSE values
