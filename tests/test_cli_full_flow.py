"""
End-to-end integration test for the BALANCE-pyexcel CLI.

Checks the following workflow:
- Running the CLI on sample CSV data.
- Targeting a macro-enabled workbook (.xlsm).
- Verifying the CLI completes successfully.
- Verifying the temporary XLSX file (.temp.xlsx) is created as expected.
- Verifying the lock file (.lock) is cleaned up after execution.
- Verifying the temporary XLSX contains the expected sheets ('Transactions', 'Queue_Review').
- Verifying the 'Transactions' sheet in the temporary file contains data rows.
