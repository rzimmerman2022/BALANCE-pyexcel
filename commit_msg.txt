Sprint #3 — Literal Extraction (Phase A)

Scope
• config/balance_analyzer.yaml
• src/baseline_analyzer/_settings.py
• src/baseline_analyzer/processing.py
• tests/balance_analyzer/test_processing_config.py

Key Points
1. Added new configurable literals
   • amount_col (“Amount”)
   • date_col (“Date”)
   • baseline_floor_date (“2000-01-01”)

2. Extended Settings dataclass
   – Included the three new fields.
   – Added lightweight stubs when *pydantic-settings* is absent so the
     project can run in minimal CI containers.

3. processing.py refactor
   – Replaced hard-coded strings with config-driven helper accessors.
   – Centralised literal retrieval; downstream logic calls
     amount_col(), date_col(), baseline_floor_date().

4. Tests
   – New test_processing_config verifies defaults + BA_ env overrides.
   – Entire test suite passes (pytest -q).

5. Validation
   – Grep confirms zero literal leaks in processing.py.
   – All tests: ..... 100 % green.

This commit completes Phase A of Sprint #3.
