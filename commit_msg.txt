chore: consolidate outstanding source updates

* Updated pyproject.toml / poetry.lock after dependency refresh
* Minor refactors across src/balance_pipeline/* and tests/*
* Removed generated Parquet from version control (workbook/balance_final.parquet) and expanded .gitignore
* Staged deletion of previously used commit_message.txt

(No functional logic changes intended in this consolidation.)
