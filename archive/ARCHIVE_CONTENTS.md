## üóÇÔ∏è **ARCHIVED CATEGORIES**

### **DEPRECATED (archive/deprecated/)**
Files that are old, unused, or superseded by newer implementations:

**Status:** Ready for future deletion after review period
**Reasoning:** These files served their purpose but are no longer needed for current operations

*Items to be moved here during cleanup:*
- Duplicate configuration files superseded by current versions
- Old documentation files replaced by standardized versions  
- Legacy script versions replaced by current implementations

### **EXPERIMENTAL (archive/experimental/)**
Investigation tools and unfinished features that may have research value:

**Current Contents:**
- `investigations/` - Critical issue investigators and financial analysis tools
- `analysis/` - Deep analysis and verification scripts
- Various debugging and diagnostic tools

**Status:** Keep for reference but not part of active codebase
**Reasoning:** These tools were used for troubleshooting and investigation but are not part of the main pipeline

### **REDUNDANT (archive/redundant/)**
Files that duplicate functionality available elsewhere:

**Status:** Can be deleted after confirming no unique functionality
**Reasoning:** Multiple implementations of the same functionality create maintenance burden

*Items to be moved here during cleanup:*
- Duplicate PowerShell scripts
- Alternative implementations of existing features
- Old versions of files that have been superseded

### **LEGACY (archive/legacy/)**
**Pre-existing archive from previous cleanup efforts**

Contains historical project versions and abandoned approaches. This directory existed before the current cleanup and contains:

- `_ARCHIVE_FOR_REVIEW_BEFORE_DELETION/` - Files marked for potential deletion
- `_ARCHIVE_TO_DELETE_OLD/` - Files ready for deletion
- Multiple duplicate copies of old project implementations
- Virtual environment files (should never be in repository)
- Old project structures from earlier development phases

**Status:** Requires careful review - some items ready for deletion
**Reasoning:** Previous cleanup efforts accumulated files here

### **GENERATED (archive/generated/)**
**Pre-existing archive of generated outputs and reports**

Contains outputs from various analysis runs and temporary processing results:

- `artifacts/` - Pipeline output artifacts
- `audit_reports/` - Historical audit reports with timestamps
- `data/` - Processed data files and CSV outputs
- `fixtures/` - Test data and sample files
- `logs/` - Historical log files from pipeline runs
- `reports/` - Generated analysis reports

**Status:** Keep sample files, clean up duplicates
**Reasoning:** Some generated files are useful for reference, but many are redundant

## üßπ **CLEANUP ACTIONS TAKEN**

### **Files Moved to Organized Structure**
*(This section will be updated as cleanup progresses)*

**2025-08-10 - Initial Archive Organization:**
- Created structured archive directory layout
- Documented existing archive contents
- Prepared for systematic file reorganization

### **Files Deleted**
*(This section will be updated as cleanup progresses)*

**None yet** - Following conservative approach of archiving first, deleting later

### **Files Cleaned Up**
*(This section will be updated as cleanup progresses)*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **Preservation Strategy**
- **Conservative Approach:** Archive first, delete later after review period
- **Business Logic:** Some archived files may contain important business rules or logic
- **Historical Value:** Investigation scripts may be valuable for future troubleshooting
- **Data Safety:** Never delete files that might contain unique data or configurations

### **Review Guidelines**
- Review archived files quarterly to determine if they can be safely deleted
- Before deleting, ensure no unique functionality or data would be lost
- Consider creating summary documentation for complex archived tools
- Maintain this documentation as archive contents change

### **Access Information**
- **Current Archive Size:** ~500+ files across multiple categories
- **Largest Category:** Legacy archive with multiple project versions
- **High Priority for Review:** `_ARCHIVE_TO_DELETE_OLD/` directory
- **Most Valuable:** Investigation tools and analysis scripts

## üìû **MAINTENANCE**

This archive should be reviewed and maintained regularly:

1. **Quarterly Review:** Assess if archived items can be safely deleted
2. **Size Monitoring:** Monitor archive size to prevent repository bloat
3. **Documentation Updates:** Keep this file current as contents change
4. **Access Control:** Ensure archived files don't accidentally get included in builds

**Archive Status: Organized and Documented**  
**Next Review Date: 2025-11-10 (3 months)**
