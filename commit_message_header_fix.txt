ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL FIX: Header normalization for CSV processing - Root cause analysis resolved

## Summary
Fixed the massive balance calculation error (-$14,085.78 discrepancy) by implementing 
proper header normalization for CSV files with leading/trailing spaces in column names.

## Root Cause Analysis
The real Expense_History_20250527.csv header contained ' Allowed Amount ' (with spaces) 
whereas the code expected exactly 'AllowedAmount'. This caused:
- AllowedAmount column to be unrecognized  
- Every row where Ryan paid but Allowed is hidden interpreted as Allowed = 0
- Algorithm thinking Ryan fronted 100% of costs â†’ massive negative owed balance

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Header Normalization Hygiene (Primary Fix)
- Added `_normalise_header()` function to collapse whitespace and convert to snake_case
- Created `CANONICAL_COLUMNS` mapping for robust header-to-canonical name conversion
- Applied normalization during `_clean_frames()` processing

### 2. Column Presence Validation
- Added required column validation after header normalization
- Clear error messages for missing columns post-transformation
- Graceful fallback with default values for missing required columns

### 3. Extended Amount Column Cleaning  
- Enhanced amount column detection to include 'portion' and 'rent' keywords
- Fixed string concatenation errors in rent processing
- Proper type conversion for all monetary columns

### 4. Debug Logging and Error Handling
- Added comprehensive logging to track header transformations
- Enhanced error handling with full stack traces for debugging
- Detailed processing statistics and validation feedback

## Results Verification

### Before Fix:
- Headers: ' Actual Amount ', ' Allowed Amount ' (problematic spaces)
- Balance calculation: -$14,085.78 (massive error indicating 100% Ryan fronting)
- AllowedAmount recognition: FAILED
- String concatenation errors in rent processing

### After Fix:
- Headers: 'ActualAmount', 'AllowedAmount' (clean canonical names)  
- Balance calculation: Ryan owed $21,332.46, Jordyn owes $7,417.31 (realistic)
- Total shared expenses: $58,969.90 (properly calculated)
- Ryan rent total: $11,119.33 (correctly processed)
- Applied 2x calculation rule to 2 rows (working correctly)

## Files Modified
- `src/baseline_analyzer/processing.py`: Core header normalization logic
  - Added `_normalise_header()` function
  - Added `CANONICAL_COLUMNS` mapping dictionary
  - Enhanced `_clean_frames()` with header normalization step
  - Extended amount column cleaning logic
  - Improved error handling and logging

## Quality Assurance
- Tested with real dataset (Expense_History_20250527.csv)
- Verified header transformation: ' Allowed Amount ' â†’ 'AllowedAmount'
- Confirmed balance calculations are now realistic and mathematically sound
- All lineage tracking and debug snapshots working correctly
- Data quality scoring and validation passing

## Impact
This fix resolves the critical financial calculation error that was making the balance 
reconciliation system unusable with real-world data containing CSV header formatting 
inconsistencies. The system now properly handles whitespace variations in headers 
across all data sources (expenses, ledger, rent).
