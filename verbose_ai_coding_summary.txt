## AI Coding Task Summary: Resolve PyArrow Installation and Test Failures

**Objective:** Address build failures related to `pyarrow` and subsequently fix any test failures to ensure a stable environment.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Initial Diagnosis & Python Version Check:**
    *   Read `pyproject.toml` to determine Python version constraints (`>=3.11,<3.14`).
    *   Executed `python --version` to find the active version: `Python 3.13.1`.
    *   Checked for CMake: `cmake --version` (not found initially).

2.  **Attempted PyArrow Build (Option 2 - Build from Source with CMake):**
    *   User installed CMake.
    *   Attempted `poetry lock` and `poetry install`.
        *   Encountered issues with `poetry lock --no-update` (option not recognized). Switched to `poetry lock`.
        *   `poetry install` failed: `error: command 'cmake' failed: None`, indicating issues with finding the C++ toolchain ("Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" was being assumed by the build script).
    *   User installed Visual Studio 2022.
    *   Retried `poetry install` attempting to specify CMake generator:
        *   Tried `$env:CMAKE_GENERATOR = "Visual Studio 17 2022"`: Still failed, build script likely uses `PYARROW_CMAKE_GENERATOR`.
        *   Tried `$env:PYARROW_CMAKE_GENERATOR = "Visual Studio 17 2022"`: Build progressed further but failed with `CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:271 (find_package): Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Arrow"`. This meant the Arrow C++ libraries themselves were not found for `pyarrow` to build against.

3.  **Attempted Pre-built Wheel (Option 1):**
    *   Tried `poetry add pyarrow@16.0.0 --extras parquet` for Python 3.13. This also failed to find a compatible wheel and attempted a source build, failing with the same CMake/Arrow C++ library issue.

4.  **Switched to Python 3.12 (Recommended Path A):**
    *   Installed Python 3.12.10 using `winget install --id Python.Python.3.12 --source winget`.
    *   Switched Poetry environment: `poetry env use 3.12`.
    *   Updated lock file: `poetry lock`.
    *   Made `pyarrow` a non-optional dependency again in `pyproject.toml`.
    *   Installed dependencies: `poetry install`. This successfully installed `pyarrow==16.1.0` (likely from a pre-built wheel for Python 3.12).
    *   Verified installation: `poetry run python -c "import pyarrow, sys; print(pyarrow.__version__, sys.version)"` (Output: `16.1.0 3.12.10 ...`).

5.  **Addressed Initial Test Failures after PyArrow Fix:**
    *   Ran `poetry run pytest -q`. Encountered `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'`.
    *   Added `opencv-python` dependency: `poetry add opencv-python`.
    *   Re-ran tests. 16 failures remained.

6.  **Iterative Test Failure Fixes:**
    *   **Merchant Lookup Rule:** Modified `rules/merchant_lookup.csv` to change `COFFEE SHOP` to `^COFFEE SHOP$` to make the pattern more specific and fix `test_normalize.py::test_clean_merchant_with_csv_rule`.
    *   **Parquet Selective Load Test:** Updated `tests/test_parquet_selective_load.py` in `test_selective_load_handles_missing_columns_gracefully` to expect `(KeyError, pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid)` instead of just `KeyError`, as `pyarrow` raises `ArrowInvalid` for missing columns.
    *   **Merchant CLI Test Fixture:** Modified `tests/test_merchant_cli.py` in the `project_root_for_cli_tests` fixture to create a dummy `src/balance_pipeline/__init__.py`. This was to address errors where `poetry run` in a temporary `cwd` couldn't find the package.
    *   **Merchant CLI Unicode Error:** Removed the '👍' emoji from a `print()` statement in `src/balance_pipeline/cli_merchant.py` to resolve a `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows when running CLI tests via subprocess.

**File Modifications Summary:**
*   `pyproject.toml`: Changed `pyarrow` to optional and back to direct; added `opencv-python`.
*   `rules/merchant_lookup.csv`: Modified `COFFEE SHOP` regex.
*   `tests/test_normalize.py`: Added `caplog.set_level()` calls (though these specific tests still fail, indicating a deeper issue with log capture during module reload).
*   `tests/test_parquet_selective_load.py`: Updated expected exception.
*   `tests/test_merchant_cli.py`: Updated `project_root_for_cli_tests` fixture.
*   `src/balance_pipeline/cli_merchant.py`: Removed emoji from print statement.
*   `AGENTS.MD`: Content was inadvertently overwritten and then restored (content should be double-checked).

**Outstanding Issues / Next Steps (Not Addressed):**
*   **`test_cli_integration.py` failures (4 tests):** These still fail with `EmptyDataError` or `AssertionError: assert 0 == 3`. The root cause seems to be that the test CSVs are not being processed correctly by the schema matching logic in `ingest.py` (logs indicate "No schema definition found in registry"). This requires investigating `rules/schema_registry.yml` and the CSV fixtures used in these tests.
*   **`test_master_parquet.py::test_append_to_master_parquet` failure:** `AssertionError: Parquet file was not created`. The `PARQUET_FILE_PATH` constant or the file/directory creation logic within `append_to_master` (likely in `scripts/process_pdfs.py`) needs review.
*   **`test_merchant.py::test_normalize_merchant[WALMART SUPERCENTER-Walmart]` failure:** `AssertionError: assert 'Walmart Supercenter' == 'Walmart'`. The rule `WAL\sMART.*,Walmart` should handle this. The `normalize_merchant` function or how rules are loaded/cached might still have an issue.
*   **`test_normalize.py` logging failures (3-4 tests):** Tests related to `load_merchant_lookup` (e.g., `test_load_merchant_lookup_file_not_found_uses_fallback`, `test_load_merchant_lookup_malformed_row_is_skipped`, `test_load_merchant_lookup_invalid_regex_raises_valueerror`, `test_load_merchant_lookup_invalid_header`) are still failing to assert expected log messages or raise ValueErrors. This suggests a persistent issue with how `caplog` interacts with `importlib.reload` or how errors/logs are propagated from the module-level `_load_merchant_lookup` function.
*   **`AGENTS.MD` content:** The file was accidentally overwritten with test code and then had its original content restored. Its current state should be manually verified to ensure it's correct.

The primary goal of resolving the `pyarrow` installation was achieved by switching to Python 3.12. Several subsequent test failures were addressed, but a number remain.
