feat(pdf): Replace Camelot with Tabula for PDF processing

Replaces the Camelot library with Tabula-py for extracting tables from PDF bank statements. This change simplifies dependencies by removing the need for Ghostscript and potentially improves table extraction accuracy.

Key Changes:

- **Dependencies:**
    - Removed `camelot-py[cv]` from `pyproject.toml`.
    - Added `tabula-py` and its optional dependency `jpype1` to `pyproject.toml`.
    - Regenerated `poetry.lock`.
- **PDF Processing Script (`scripts/process_pdfs.py`):**
    - Replaced `camelot.read_pdf` with `tabula.read_pdf`.
    - Added encoding fallback logic (UTF-8 -> CP-1252) for `tabula.read_pdf`.
    - Implemented filtering logic to remove non-transaction rows based on expected date (`MM/DD`) and amount patterns in specific columns (indices 10 and 14).
    - Updated column renaming to use fixed indices (9-14) after filtering, mapping to `AccountLast4`, `TransDate`, `PostDate`, `ReferenceNumber`, `RawMerchant`, `Amount`.
    - Removed previous complex header detection and date pre-parsing logic.
- **Ingestion Logic (`src/balance_pipeline/ingest.py`):**
    - Added specific date parsing logic for the `jordyn_pdf` schema to handle `MM/DD` format and infer the year (current year, or previous year if the date is in the future).
- **Schema Registry (`rules/schema_registry.yml`):**
    - Updated the `jordyn_pdf` schema:
        - Removed the `date_format` key (now handled in `ingest.py`).
        - Corrected the `column_map` to reflect the actual columns output by the updated `process_pdfs.py` (`TransDate`, `RawMerchant`, `Amount`, `AccountLast4`).
        - Set `sign_rule` to `flip_if_positive`.
- **Build Process:**
    - Updated PyInstaller command to use `poetry run pyinstaller`.
    - Removed bundling of non-existent `py.typed` file.
    - Ensured `rules` directory is bundled correctly using `--add-data "rules;rules"`.
- **Testing:**
    - Successfully ran the rebuilt executable end-to-end, confirming ingestion of PDF-derived CSVs alongside standard bank exports.

BREAKING CHANGE: The `camelot-py` dependency and its system requirement (Ghostscript) have been removed. `tabula-py` and Java (>= 1.7) are now required for PDF processing. The structure of CSVs generated from PDFs has changed.
