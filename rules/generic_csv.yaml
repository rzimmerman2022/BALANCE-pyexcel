# A minimal signature; actual matching for generic is more flexible
# This signature helps it get picked up by the loader, but true generic matching
# might not strictly enforce this if it's a true fallback.
# For now, let's use the fields it previously considered 'required'.
header_signature:
  - "Date"
  - "Amount"
  - "Merchant" # Or "Description" - generic matching is tricky with a fixed signature

column_map:
  "Date": "Date"
  "Amount": "Amount"
  "Merchant": "Merchant"
  "Description": "OriginalDescription" # Map 'Description' if found to OriginalDescription
  # Allow other common master schema columns to be picked up if they exist by chance
  "Category": "Category"
  "Account": "Account"
  "Notes": "Note"
  "Tags": "Tags"
  "Original Statement": "OriginalDescription" # If 'Original Statement' is found

derived_columns:
  Owner:
    rule: "static_value"
    value: "UnknownOwner"
  DataSourceName:
    rule: "static_value"
    value: "GenericCSV"

date_format: null # Allow pandas to infer date format for generic CSVs
sign_rule: "as_is" # Assume amounts are correctly signed for generic
extras_ignore: [] # Preserve all other columns in Extras by default for generic
